Our stock management system simplifies inventory control. Users register and log in securely, with password retrieval via email verification if needed. Once logged in, they can add products, search for items by name or code, and view a list displaying product names, codes, prices, and quantities.

The sales section allows easy recording of transactions by entering the product ID and quantity sold. This action automatically updates the available quantity, ensuring accurate inventory tracking.
